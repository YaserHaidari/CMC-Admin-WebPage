## ðŸ”– Introduction

Cyberfleet: Coffee Meets Careers (CMC) was created to bridge the gap between tertiary education and the requirements of the cybersecurity industry.

Our mission is to connect university students with experienced industry professionals, providing them with an opportunity to learn through mentorships and career insights from industry experience. By supporting these connections, Cyberfleet aims to empower the next generation of cybersecurity talents to transition from academic learning to the professional industry.

The Admin Webpage was built using **React** and connects directly to **Supabase**, allowing administrators to manage user data efficiently. Admin users can:

- Create new users (Mentees and Mentors)
- View all users in a structured table format
- Suspend any user from using the app
- Delete user accounts when necessary

The application operates with the Coffee Meets Careers Supabase database and updates the `users`, `mentees`, and `mentors` tables in real-time.
